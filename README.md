This project was developed by a team of five people in a 24-hour `hackathon` project, for the third and last round of group projects @ <Academia de Código_>'s bootcamp#29, taking place by the end of the 13th week of code learning.

## The project Idea
The project began with a challenge: develop a product inspired by a song, “Leave me alone” by NF. This amazing rap brought to us concepts like mental health, expression and dealing with expectations. 
How to succeed in a group while being different? How do I deal with others that are different from me? 
We decided to create a web application that serves as a repository of group dynamics especially created to promote the development of social skills in educational or work contexts

## Development
We started to allocate a scrum sprint to brainstorm the idea and the SCRUM sprints planning.
Afterwards we received the main hackathon’s theme and started to work on the first sprint by brainstorming ideas to decide what we would do.
We started to split stories amongst the members of the group to start working on the development. Git, and basic skeleton project were created, and then we organized the team into a front and back end development, and content creation composition.
We created the basic JSON data concept that we used through the project in order to have both teams work according to the same JSON composition, this decision was made to facilitate the merge between front and back end development.
The backend team started to work on creating the REST API to feed JSON’s to the frontend team, and the frontend team started creating the bootstrap HTML+CSS pages with Javascript to feed on the REST API.
When all sprint stories were completed, we regrouped and discussed the next sprint and stories with the feedback of the previous ones, adjusting the timetable and next sprints accordingly.
During the last sprint we focused the entire team on stories critical to the MVP in order to meet the deadline with a working project.
By the end of the deadline we had a working, functional MVP project.
